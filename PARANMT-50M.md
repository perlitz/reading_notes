# [ParaNMT-50M: Pushing the Limits of Paraphrastic Sentence Embeddings with Millions of Machine Translations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05732)

 PARANMT-50M, a dataset of more than **50 million English-English sentential paraphrase pairs**. 

We generated the pairs **automatically** by using **neural machine translation** (back-translation) to translate the non English side of a large parallel corpus, following Wieting et al. (2017). 

Our hope is that PARANMT-50M can be a **valuable resource for paraphrase generation** and can provide a rich source of semantic knowledge to improve downstream natural language understanding tasks. 

To show its utility, we use PARANMT-50M to train paraphrastic sentence embeddings that outperform all supervised systems on every SemEval semantic textual similarity competition, in addition to showing how it can be used for paraphrase generation.
