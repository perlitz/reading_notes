# [BLEU: a Method for Automatic Evaluation of Machine Translation (Papineni 01)](https://aclanthology.org/P02-1040.pdf)

BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy Score) score was proposed by IBM in 2001 as an automatic metric for Machine translation tasks. (Papineni et al. 2001) It is based on n-gram precision (i.e., the fraction of matching n-grams to the total number of generated n-grams) and applies a so-called ‘brevity penalty’, which penalizes translations that show significantly shorter length compared to the reference translation.
