# How to read research papers 

From a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=733m6qBH-jI) by Andrew Ng

Steps:

1. Compile a list of papers/posts.
2. Skip through the list (quickly skip around them) reading to ~10% understanding
3. In case other interesting sources comes along, add to list.

Reading 1 paper - Make multiple passes:

1. Read the Title, Abstract and figures
2. Go over the Intro, Conclusions, then skim the rest
3. Read but skip the math
4. Read but skip things you do not understand

After reading a paper one should ask:

1. What did the authors tries to accomplish?
2. What were the key elements of the approach?
3. What could you use yourself?
4. What other references do you want to follow?
